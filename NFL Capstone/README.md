## NFL Capstone Project Repository
> This repository contains all Python Jupyter notebooks and data sets (except for Armchair Analysis data because it is too large to upload on GitHub and is not publicly available without purchase) necessary to build the predictive models for my Springboard Data Science Intensive capstone project. All csv files in this repository were either data used to build the models or written files outputted from the Jupyter notebooks described below.

##Jupyter Notebooks

**Regularized Logistic Regression Model (2014-2016 Season Data).ipynb**

* Jupyter notebook used to build naive baseline model on NFL Savant data set

**Regularized Logistic Regression Model  (Armchair Analysis 2014-2016).ipynb**

* Jupyter notebook used to build dependency model on Armchair Analysis data set

**Team by Team Logistic Regression Model (2014-2016 data).ipynb**

* Jupyter notebook used to build the team based models utilizing the naive independence assumption on NFL Savant data set

**Team by Team Logistic Regression Model  (Armchair Analysis 2014-2016).ipynb**

* Jupyter notebook used build team based models utilizing the dependency assumption on the Armchair Analysis data set

**Analysis of Team Based Logistic Regression Model (2014-2016).ipynb**

* Jupyter notebook used to analyze the model metrics of the team based models' (built using naive assumption of independence between plays on NFL Savant data set)

**Analysis of Team Based Logistic Regression Model Armchair Analysis (2014-2016 data).ipynb**

* Jupyter notebook used to analyze the model metrics of the team based models' (built using the dependency assumption between plays on Armchair Analysis data set)

**Model Coefficients.ipynb**

* Jupyter notebook used to filter model coefficients for both baseline and dependency models
* made it is easy to see which coefficients were most significant to each model
